## Components of an Android App:


* **Activity**
   
The user interface -- basically it's what's there on your screen
 

* **Service**
   
This is a background process without a UI (like a music player)


* **Content Manager**
   
This allows applications to share data (like flappy bird high scores)


* **Broadcast Receiver**
  
 This responds to events, and can be used to trigger stuff for your process
(example events: Phone ring, Low battery, SMS)
